# d3-horizon-chart

`d3-horizon-chart` is a d3 plugin that draws horizon charts using an Html5 Canvas.
It provides an easy way to visualize large amounts of time series data.


The plugin is heavily inspired by [cubism.js](https://square.github.io/cubism/), but doesn't make assumptions about real-time metrics and back-end servers such as Cube/Graphite.

It is a good option when you just want to plot your data as a horizon chart.

*v.0.0.1*
The plug-in supports positive bands.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-horizon-chart`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/kmandov/d3-horizon-chart/releases/latest).
