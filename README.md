# d3-horizon-chart

`d3-horizon-chart` is a d3 plugin that draws a horizon chart using a canvas element.
The plugin is heavily inspired by cubism.js, but doesn't make assumptions about a back-end server such as Cube/Graphite. This makes it easier to just draw horizon charts based on your data.

v.0.0.1
The plug-in supports positive bands.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-horizon-chart`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/kmandov/d3-horizon-chart/releases/latest).
